	abstract = {Pandora Internet Radio (also known as Pandora Radio or simply Pandora) is a music streaming and automated music recommendation service powered by the Music Genome Project. As of August 1, 2017, the service, operated by Pandora Media, Inc., is available only in the United States. On July 14, 2017, Pandora emailed Australasian users to notify them that New Zealand and Australian access to Pandora would cease on July 31, 2017.
The service plays songs that have similar musical traits. The user then provides positive or negative feedback (as thumbs up or thumbs down) for songs chosen by the service, and the feedback is taken into account in the subsequent selection of other songs to play. The service can be accessed either through a web browser or by downloading and installing application software on the user's device such as a personal computer or mobile phone.},
