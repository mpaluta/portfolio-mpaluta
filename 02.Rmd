## "I just want to get my music out and make sure that it's heard in the right way." -Dr. Dre

Do you ever find changing radio stations during the outro of a song? Or skipping ahead to your favorite part of a song on Spotify? Or maybe you like to hear songs in their entirety, but that darn DJ keeps jumping around and killing your vibe. Have you mastered the art of a good playlist progression when you're assigned as the DJ in a car full of your friends?

## "I love technology. We can be our own DJs wherever we go." -Ludacris

Enter Data4DJs: a service that informs DJs about listeners' preferences, allowing optimal mixing of sets.

This service doesn't replace artistic creativity; it is complementary.

```{r experimental,echo=F,results='asis',eval=F}
data.table::fread('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UCB-MIDS/experiments-causality/master/data/GerberGreenBook_Chapter3_Donations.csv?token=ABNmuX-Q14rzQ4teItDenc9L5Wo2flncks5ZL5qEwA%3D%3D') %>% stargazer::stargazer(type = 'html',title = 'Something from W241 Experiments and Causality')

## "A DJ can't just play one song. It's about playing a set, or how you connect songs in those two hours, and where you place them." -Zedd

Whether at a rave, a wedding, or jamming with your friends, Data4DJs allows you to have the optimal listening experience as backed by research, data, and your own preferences.
